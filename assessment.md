# Assessment

When your project is finished, or as it's in progress if it's helpful, assess your project. Review the [project rubric](http://cs.fablearn.org/courses/cs10/unit00/project/) and then decide how your project should score on each criterion. Write a paragraph for each criterion justifying your assessment with evidence from your code, planning document, and commit messages.
